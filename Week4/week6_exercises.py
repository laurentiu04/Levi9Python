# Pandas Exercises
"""
 Import the dataset from the week6_dataset folder in different dataframes.
 (sales, targets, product, salesperson, region)
 Using this data respond to the next questions:

 1. Which is the most profitable month on average?
    # clean sales data (remove $ and covert 'Sales', 'Cost' to float)
    # compute 'Margin' column = 'Sales' - 'Cost'
    # convert 'OrderDate' to datetime and extract month to 'OrderMonth' (dt.month)
    # group by 'OrderMonth' compute mean for 'Margin' column
    # find the month with the highest value of mean

 2. Show names of top 5 best performing employees by total order value in 2020.
    # convert 'OrderDate' to datetime and extract year to 'Year' (dt.year)
    # filter sales by 'Year'
    # merge with salesperson by 'EmployeeKey'
    # group by 'Salesperson' to find the highest value for the sum of 'Sales'

 3. How many products were sold in 2020 grouped by product category?
    # filter sales by 'Year'
    # merge product with sales on 'ProductKey'
    # count the 'ProductKey' values grouped by 'Category'

 4. Find revenue margin, and target for each year.
    # clean target data (remove $ and covert 'Target' to float) and use also sales data
    # convert 'TargetMonth' to datetime and extract year to 'Year' (dt.year)
    # convert 'OrderDate' to datetime and extract year to 'Year' (dt.year)
    # revenue margin = group sales by 'Year' and compute the sum for 'Sales' and 'Margin' columns (from Q1)
    # target = group targets by 'Year' and compute the sum of 'Target' column
    # merge revenue margin with target on 'Year'

 5. Which product category made the most profit by year?
    # merge product with sales on 'ProductKey'
    # profit it's the sum of margin column grouped by 'Year' and 'Category'
    # find the category with the highest value 'Margin'
    
 6. Find the region with largest revenue the most profitable region.
 
 7. Which country is the least profitable?
    # merge sales with region by 'SalesTerritoryKey'
    # group by 'Country' to find the min 'Margin' value

 8. How many employees missed their target in 2020? By how much?
 
 9. Create a matrix showing total sales by Year and Category.
 
 10. For every sale, calculate how much larger or smaller it is than the average sale of its category.

 11. Create a chart showing yearly revenue.
